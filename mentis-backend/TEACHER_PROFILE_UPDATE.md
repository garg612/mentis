# Teacher Profile Enhancement

This document explains the updates made to the teacher profile system to include courses, batch assignments, and subject teaching information.

## What's New

### Backend Changes

1. **Teacher Model Update** (`src/models/teacher.models.js`)
   - Added `subjectTeaching` field to store subjects being taught
   - Enhanced existing `courses` and `batchAssigned` fields with proper structure

2. **Seed Data Update** (`seed.js`)
   - Populated all teachers with sample data:
     - **Courses**: Computer Science and Engineering (CSE101)
     - **Batch Assignments**: Batch 1, Section A
     - **Subject Teaching**: Each teacher assigned to teach specific subjects with codes

### Frontend Changes

1. **Teacher Profile Section** (`teacher.html`)
   - Added new "Teaching Information" section in the profile
   - Displays courses, batch assignments, and subjects teaching

2. **Profile Loading** (`teacher.js`)
   - Updated to load and display teaching information in the profile section
   - Shows formatted information for courses, batches, and subjects

## Teacher Assignments

| Teacher | Employee ID | Subject Teaching | Subject Code |
|---------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| Ananya  | T001        | DBMS             | DBM 901      |
| Arjun   | T002        | Life Skill       | LSK 901      |
| Kavita  | T003        | Ethics           | ETH 901      |
| Meera   | T004        | Python           | PYT 901      |
| Rajesh  | T005        | DSA              | DSA 901      |
| Vikram  | T006        | OS               | OSY 901      |

## How to Use

### For New Teachers

When creating new teacher records, include the teaching information:

```javascript
{
  "name": "Teacher Name",
  "empId": "T007",
  "department": "Computer Science",
  "designation": "Assistant Professor",
  "email": "teacher@college.edu",
  "courses": [
    {
      "code": "CSE101",
      "name": "Computer Science and Engineering"
    }
  ],
  "batchAssigned": [
    {
      "batchNo": 2,
      "section": "B"
    }
  ],
  "subjectTeaching": [
    {
      "subject": "Web Development",
      "subjectCode": "WEB 901",
      "batchNo": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Updating Existing Data

To update existing teacher data with the new fields, run the seed script:

```bash
cd mentis911/mentis-backend
node seed.js
```

## Display Format

The teaching information is displayed in the teacher profile as:

- **Courses**: "Computer Science and Engineering "
- **Batch Assigned**: "Batch 1"
- **Subjects Teaching**: "DBMS (DBM 901) - Batch 1"

## Backward Compatibility

- The system is fully backward compatible
- If teaching information is not available, it will display "No [courses/batches/subjects] assigned"
- Existing teachers without this data will continue to work normally

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Start your backend server
2. Login as a teacher
3. Navigate to the Profile section
4. Verify that the "Teaching Information" section displays the courses, batch assignments, and subjects

The information should appear in the same style as other profile information, maintaining consistency with the existing design.
